You would learn the fundermental learning methods in neural networks
in this course. Although some of you might have already done much advanced research 
on neural networks, it would still be interesting to know how neural networks had
developed from the beginning. The course contents were made by Prof. Qiangfu Zhao long ago.

Two lectures will be given at the 7th and 8th periods while students will do the projects 
at the 9th to 10th period. You may have discussions with me after the classes or write
your questions to me at the 9th and 10th period by email (emails sent on other time are fine).

Such arrangements of two-period lectures and two-period project time have
been made for many years. The purpose is to let students understand the
topics better by doing simple simulations at the same time.

2. Team Projects:


There are over 40 students in our classes. Some of students might cancel this course after taking 
a few lectures. We would encourage the students to do the projects with team members together. 
By doing team projects, you could improve your skills of communications and discussions.

1) Team project: each team can have 4 members at most. If too many members, 

hard to communicate. If too few members, less discussions. Please find your
team members by checking our course mailing list.

2) Each team just submit one report (team report) for one project to me by email. Please 

include all member's names in the report.

3) Submit the report by email to me (in PDF format). Use the title (subject) 

of "Project XX of CSA01", where "XX" is the number of the project. For an example.
"Project 1 of CSA01"

4) Deadline for project. Normally two weeks (excluding holidays) are given after one project

is assigned. Anyhow, the deadline for Project 1 would be set as the same deadline for
Project 2. That is, May 2. Students would need time to form a team at the beginning. 

5) What should be included in the team report?


You can write your team project in your own style. Anyhow, good reports
should reflect your good understanding. Generally, each report includes:

a) The solved problem. 

b) The used method. 

c) Discussions on the simulation results.

Simple descriptions for a) and b) are fine if both the problems and methods are given in the lectures 
or project.

It would be better to give more discussions in c) (the more the better). If team members would discuss 
each other on the results, they would have a lot to write. 

Besides, if the team would like to do more (just optional, not required). They might try:

d) New problems proposed by the team members. If a new problem, please describe it in detail.

e) Modifications (or improvement) made to the methods. Please describe the modifications in details.

f) New simulations, and discussions on the new results.

6) How to grade? 


Each Team Report including a), b) and c) would get 80 points if submitted before deadline.

Each Team Report including a), b), c), and other more results in d), e), and f) would get 20 points at most
(still submitted before deadline.)

Late team reports would get less points.

If any questions related the course and projects, please let me know. Please use "CSA01 XXX" (XXX means your subject) 
as the mail subject whenever you send an email to me.
